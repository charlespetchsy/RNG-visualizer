# RNG-visualizer
- Random number generation is the generation of a sequence of numbers or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by a random chance, usually through a hardware random-number generator (RNG). - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation)
- Test to see if a RNG is consistent or skewed
- Provide statistical analysis with output to CLI
- Calculating running time for each algorithm

## Testing
Languages that will be tested include:
- Java
- Python
- R
- Ruby
- C/C++
- C#
- Objective-C
- Bash
- JavaScript
- Matlab

## Results (Placeholders for now)
Java Output
-----------
```java
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Prints "Hello, World" in the terminal window.
      System.out.println("Hello, World");
   }
}
```

Python Output
-------------
```python 
print("Hello, World!")
```
