# RNG-visualizer
- Random number generation is the generation of a sequence of numbers or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by a random chance, usually through a hardware random-number generator (RNG). - [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation)
- Test to see if a RNG is consistent or skewed
- Provide statistical analysis with output to CLI
- Calculating running time for each algorithm

## Testing
Languages that will be testing include:
- Java
- Python
- R
- Ruby
- C/C++
- Bash
- JavaScript

## Results
